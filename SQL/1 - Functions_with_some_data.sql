-- USING SOME FUNCTIONS:

-- Here i'll upload some simple data so practice some of learning:

-- Drop the PETRESCUE table in case it exists
DROP TABLE PETRESCUE;
-- Create the PETRESCUE table 
CREATE TABLE PETRESCUE (
    ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
    ANIMAL VARCHAR(20),
    QUANTITY INTEGER,
    COST DECIMAL(6,2),
    RESCUEDATE DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
  );
-- Insert sample data into PETRESCUE table
INSERT
  INTO PETRESCUE
  VALUES 
	(1,'Cat',9,450.09,'2018-05-29') ,
	(2,'Dog',3,666.66,'2018-06-01'),
